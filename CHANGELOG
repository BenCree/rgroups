** [UNPUBLISHED] version 1.4.***
 - rmol.to_file now writes all conformers into the PDB using the "MODEL / ENDMDL" flavour which can be ready by
    MDAnalysis.
 - ANI in some cases explodes. Remove the bad conformers with bonds that have lengths larger than 3A.
 - The user now has to import the libraries (RGroupGrid) and instantiate first.
 - Libraries (linkers, rgroups) are now single .sdf files to avoid problems on clusters with many small files
 - A growing vector can now be any molecule-separating atom in the molecule.
 - Lipinski now uses the initial definitions of HBD: "sum of Ns and Os" and HBA: "sum of OHs and NHs",
    (thanks to @RPirie96)
 - When growing a molecule C multiple time in the same session (e.g. +linker +R), the .template attribute will
    always be the original C
 - Lipinski now uses the initial definitions of HBD: "sum of Ns and Os" and HBA: "sum of OHs and NHs",
    (thanks to @RPirie96)
 - R-group without coordinates are now using by default Chem.rdDistGeom.EmbedMolecule
 - Do not cache openff parameters into db.json which right now crashes when multiple threads are used (same filename)
 - using a tempfile with the anipotential .pt model file for for thread safety
 - gnina column is renamed from "CNNaffinity->IC50s" to "Kd" with nM unit. We added pint-pandas package for units.
 - rgroups and linkers are now dataframe (simpler API access)

**version 1.3.0**

 - Compatibility with openff-toolkit >=0.11 (thanks to @jeeberhardt for #29 #30)


**version 1.2.1**

 - refined library coordinates (Ben)
 - visualisations with pandas
 - error handling


**version 1.2.0**

- [Feature] Linkers with a library, with simpler searchable SMILEs
- Fix: [PR#20] Using the conda-forge package openmm-ml


**version 1.1.0**

- Fix: [RP] ExactMolWt used in the lipinski Ro5 is for mass spec/crystallography for specific isotopes. Moving on to the more appropriate MolWt.


**version 1.0.2**

- adjusting the files for the conda-release


**version 1.0.1**

- Fix+Feature: optimise_in_receptor function now takes platform_name argument allowing to use cuda or cpu for non-ani or ani optimisation.
- Fix: embedding openmm-ml into fegrow in order to create a conda package


**version 1.0**

- Initial release
